This is a personal finance manager. It uses the Silex framework for the back end. It contains fully functional unit tests. It is well documented. It is a RESTful API leveraging the best of Doctrine ORM including foreign RDBMS relationships and aggregate functions. PSR-0 is honored and the application uses best practices in regards to exceptions and returning HTTP status codes. The front end will be multi-part. Initially it will be an AngularJS UI but I plan to build an entirely different API in ExtJS. You can use this application to bootstrap your own applications. If you are a PHP developer I don't think there is a better stack than Silex + Doctrine ORM + PHPUnit. ALL of this code and work has been done on my free time and is 100% free for you to use with or without credit. It's not like I invented any of this. Like you, I have spent hours on Google and StackOverflow to make this happen. Enjoy! - tmpjr
